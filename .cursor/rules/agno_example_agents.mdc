"""üéì Research Scholar Agent - Your AI Academic Research Assistant!

This example shows how to create a sophisticated research agent that combines
academic search capabilities with scholarly writing expertise. The agent performs
thorough research using Exa's academic search, analyzes recent publications, and delivers
well-structured, academic-style reports on any topic.

Key capabilities:
- Advanced academic literature search
- Recent publication analysis
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis
- Academic writing expertise
- Citation management

Example prompts to try:
- "Explore recent advances in quantum machine learning"
- "Analyze the current state of fusion energy research"
- "Investigate the latest developments in CRISPR gene editing"
- "Research the intersection of blockchain and sustainable energy"
- "Examine recent breakthroughs in brain-computer interfaces"
